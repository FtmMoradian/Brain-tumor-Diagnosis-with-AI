# Brain-tumor-Diagnosis-with-AI
In this project, I used the dataset available in Kaggle and implemented four algorithms for detection on it. These algorithms include: SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression and CNN, the best of which is CNN. We increased the same dataset in another file. And we implemented the same algorithms on it and saw changes in its accuracy.
