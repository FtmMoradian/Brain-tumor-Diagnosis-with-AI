# Brain-tumor-Diagnosis-with-AI
In this project, I used the dataset available in Kaggle and implemented four algorithms for detection on it. These algorithms include: SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression and CNN, the best of which is CNN. We increased the same dataset in another file. By using the augmentation technique, it strengthens itself, which in some algorithms causes its growth and accuracy, and in others makes it too appropriate.
